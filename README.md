Welcome to the Dice Rolling App repository! This project is a learning outcome in learning and implementing a dice rolling application using Flutter. The app features engaging sound effects and smooth animations to simulate the rolling of dice, providing a fun and interactive user experience, while revising the Flutter.

# Improvement

I am planning to add the feature that letting the user to manage the amount of the dice. I believe that will make this app more useful.
